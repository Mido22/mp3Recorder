Javascript MP3 recorder
=========


This is mash up demo for [libmp3lame.js][0] and [Recorderjs][1]. 

**Update**, for those who want to record user's mic and save it in server, uploading as opus packets, then you do not have to trouble yourself with mp3 licensing troubles, can check out my [opus recorder](https://github.com/Mido22/recordOpus) (p.s: not completely bug free, still working on it.)
