Javascript MP3 recorder
=========


This is mash up demo for [libmp3lame.js][0] and [Recorderjs][1]. 

Update, for those who want to record user's mic and save it in server, uploading as opus packets, then you do not have to trouble yourself with mp3 licensing troubles. [this][2] would be a good place to start.
